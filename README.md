###### Simple Comic Reader Made In HTML For Comic Integration.
------------
# Setup ðŸ”§
### Installation
The installation is simple, you just need to download the latest release from the releases tab, and open the .html file with any browser.
### Folder Structure
For the folder structure, the reader uses .jpg by default, but you can tweak it how you like.
The page names should follow this pattern: (001, 002, 003, etc...)

### Adding Pages
To add pages, locate the part in the HTML where it loads the page images, and copy it while changing the page number, pretty easy right? 
# Customization ðŸŽ¨
### Themes
Since it's HTML, it's quite easy to modify themes/add new ones.
You can achieve this by adding a section like this.

*(it isn't that simple but it's kinda like that)*
### Reading Modes
For the reading modes it's more complicated than the themes process because you need to define the xyz coordinates, the scrolling direction, the page size (at the moment), and from which direction will the pages be read.
### UI
If you know how to code well enough, you could redesign the whole ui to your taste. I'm not gonna do a tutorial since this is a lot but you get the point.
# Compatibility ðŸ“º
As of 1.1.0a, i added minimal compatibility for mobile devices, although this is really nothing. (tested on "xiaomi-sweet_k6a")
I still didn't test this on a tablet or a square monitor so i don't know about those.
